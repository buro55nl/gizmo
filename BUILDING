Necessary Modifications to Build the Code 
=========================================

You will need to modify your Arduino libraries slightly in order to build
this code successfully.  Here are the items:



-- Add Nonblocking writes to Wire.cpp and Wire.h
   This will dramatically speed up Wire.cpp for our purposes

1. Identify your Wire.cpp and Wire.h files.  On the Mac they're located in 
   Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire/src

2. Add the following line inside the "public" method space in Wire.h:

	    uint8_t endTransmissionNonblocking();

3. Add the following method to Wire.cpp:


	uint8_t TwoWire::endTransmissionNonblocking()
		{
 		// transmit buffer (blocking)
  		uint8_t ret = twi_writeTo(txAddress, txBuffer, txBufferLength, 0, 1);
  		return ret;
		}




-- Reduce the I2C buffer size from 32 to 20.
   This gives us some extra static RAM space.

1. Identify you Wire.h file.  On the Mac it's located in
   Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire/src

2. Change the BUFFER_LENGTH constant as follows:

	#define BUFFER_LENGTH 20   // Was 32

3. Identify your twi.h file.  On the Mac it's located in
   Arduino.app/Contents/Java/hardware/arduino/avr/libraries/Wire/src/utility/twi.h

4. Change the TWIBUFFER_LENGTH constant as follows:

	#define TWI_BUFFER_LENGTH 20    // Was 32
